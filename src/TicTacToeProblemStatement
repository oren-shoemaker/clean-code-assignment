Tic Tac Toe, also known as naughts and crosses, is a two-player game played on a three by three grid.  
Players take turns putting their mark, either an “O” or an “X” in a vacant space on the board. 
The game ends when one player puts three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when all the spaces are filled.

Here we represent the nine squares with numbers:

123
456
789

To save space we will have the values on a single line: 123456789

You are given five data sets.  
You are to determine if it is possible for either player to win on the next move, and if so, print the square number for the player(s). 
If both can win, print O’s move first.If no win is possible for either player on the next move, print NONE.

Each square will have either an X, an O, or B if blank.
